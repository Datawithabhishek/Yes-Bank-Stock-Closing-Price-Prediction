## Problem Statement
Yes Bank is a banking company that was founded in 2004 that offers a wide range
of differentiated products for its corporate and retail customers through retail
banking and asset management services. It is also a publically traded company.
That provides an opportunity for anyone to invest in Yes bank and become a shareholder. But at the same time, it means that the valuation of the company is
now in the hands of investors and speculators as share prices are often heavily
impacted by public opinion.
We have used yes bank stock price data set. This dataset contains 5 different
features that can be used for predicting close price prediction using machine
learning. We have built machine learning regression model for price prediction.
We have used some of best models.

### Data Source:
- [Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12gGY7WG4C2_tDHb6jI_IjTPAumHwA7Cd/view?usp=share_link) - Dataset taken from AlmaBetter

### Input Files:
  <li><b>data_YesBank_StockPrices.csv</b> - It contains monthly observation of stock parameter such as open, high , low and close.</li>



  ## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap and Navigation guide

<hr>

### Step 1: Data Collection
Collect the historical stock prices of Yes Bank from January 2005 to September 2020. Include variables such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price and date

<hr>

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Clean the dataset by removing any missing values, outliers, or errors. Preprocess the dataset by scaling or normalizing the features as necessary.

<hr>

### Step 3: Regression Model Building
Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Implement Multiple Linear Regression ,Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression and Elastic net Regression models to predict the closing price of Yes Bank stock. Tune the models by adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize performance.

<hr>

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the models' performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. Compare the performance of the models to determine which one performs better.

<hr>

### Step 5: Results and Conclusion
Present the results of the regression analysis. Discuss the implications of the results and their potential impact on investors. Provide conclusions and suggestions for future research.

## :scroll: Conclusion

After implementing various regression model and analyzing theri respective performance matrics we came to the conclusion that the <b>"Elastic net Regression"</b> is  top performing models with respect to all the matrics. But when we look for the cross validation score and other factores such as time complexity
